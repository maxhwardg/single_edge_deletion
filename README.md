# Single Edge Deletion Algorithms
This repository contains algorithms to solve the single edge deletion problem.
Make can be used to build the "main" program, which can be used to run the
algorithm(s) on a graph that is read from standard input. It also serves as
an example program that uses the algorithm implementation.
